# Dot files
A repository for my dot files

## Emacs
My [.emacs](files/.emacs) init file used to customize the [Emacs
environment](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which I use for
everything from interactive sessions of R and Python to writing
academic manuscripts in markdown, latex, or plain text.

## Rprofile
My [.Rprofile](files/.Rprofile) file, which configures startup
defaults for R sessions.

## Bashrc
My [.bashrc](files/.bashrc) file, which contains run commands to be
executed at startup for bash.
